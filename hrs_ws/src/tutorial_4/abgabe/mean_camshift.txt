Mean shift – Given a set of points and a window to be moved, the mean shift algorithm shifts the center of the window to the centroid of all points located inside the window. After this, you can repeat the process and shift the new center of this new window to the centroid of all points inside it. This process is repeated iteratively until it converges to a window position with maximum pixel distribution. 
In the context of object tracking, the  target object should be the most relevant point cloud after back projection, making the window be shifted around it. The size and orientation of the window are not changed, so changing the distance of the object to the camera might make the window fit poorly to it.

Cam shift – The cam shift algorithm follow the mean shift algorithm until the position of the window converges. After this, the size of the window is updated to better fit the point cloud and a new window orientation is calculated by finding the ellipse that best fits it. This creates a new window, that is shifted once again with the mean shift algorithm. The process is repeated until the desired accuracy is met. Unlike the mean shift algorithm, cam shift allows for the update of the size and orientation of the window.
