move_service is the server in python
client.py is the python client for exercises 1-2
client.cpp is the cpp client for the 3. exercise

Final settings are the aruco tracking with time interpolation movement and another killer_task node (because couldnt be implemented in cpp)
Maybe works better with normal setAngles command, which is also depicted in the video.
